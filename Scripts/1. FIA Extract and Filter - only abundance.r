### FILTER BY FORESTED CONDITION##
# CA: For now, you keep anything within the condition table that has a condition of 1. Its fine if it has multiple conditions
# all this means is that some plots have multiple conditions, like some of the subplots are in a lake or something
# you need to pay attention to this when you calculate growth and abundance, if some of the information is assuming
# area contributions of subplots that are alternative conditions.

#CA: we are ditching the TA/RK way. This was excludes too much. We want more information!
#COND[, CONmax := maxNA(CONDID), by=PLT_CN]
# *** RK: This is slightly wrong. In a few cases plots have CONDID>1, but still only have a single condition. This would work better:
#     COND[, CONmax2 := .N, by=PLT_CN]
#COND = COND[ CONmax==1,]

#this line says keep all sites with condition=1 (1=forested). Fine if there are multiple conditions.
#this reduces the number of unique plots within the condition table from 517,782 to 477,913
